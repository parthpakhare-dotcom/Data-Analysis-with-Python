# ðŸŒŸ Chapter 2: Python Packages for Data Science  

The Python language has a lot of libraries that we can import to use a collection of in-built functions. These functions make the task of analyzing the data very easy with just a few lines of code.  

_These Libraries are classified as:_  
1] **Scientific Computing** Libraries:- (For calculations)  

- ***Pandas***: Offer essential data structure and tools for effective data manipulation and analysis. Especially used for 2D tables called data frames, Pandas come with easy indexing functionality.  

- ***NumPy***: It uses arrays for i/ps and o/ps. It can be extended to objects for matrices.  

- **_SciPy_**: It includes functions for mathematical operations like calculus, optimization and visualization.  

2] **Vizualization** Libraries:- (For visualization)  
These libraries are the best to represent the results of the data to others as they communicate about the data in visuals.  

- **_Matplotlib_**: To make highly customizable plots and graphs  

- **_Seaborn_**: Based on Matplotlib, it is a high level visualization library used to generate plots like heat maps, time series and violin plots.  

3] **Algorithmic** Libraries:  
These are used to create models based on our data sets using machine learning and make predictions.  

- **_Scikit-learn_**: Contains tools for statistical modelling such as regression, classification, clustering, etc. The library is itself built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.  

- **_Statsmodels_**: Explores data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.
