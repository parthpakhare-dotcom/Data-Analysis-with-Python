# ðŸŒŒ GroupBy in Python

The groupby method in Python is somewhat similar to binning, but is more significant in the analytical level. Here the basic question we try to answer is:
- **Is there any `relationship` between the different types of a data / datas and an other value.**

For this, we use the Pandas' `groupby()` method. This is specifically applied for categorical variables. Here, we group the categories with the categorical variables in a group or multiple groups (columns) by passing multiple variable names. 

Eg: Grouping drive wheel type, body style type and price groups.  
- Step1: Joining the columns together.  
`df_reln=df[['drive-wheels', 'body-style', 'price']]`

- Step2: Groupby method: Making unique combinations of groups and equating the remaing parameters (price here), to the average in each unique groups.  
`df_grp = df_reln.groupby(['drive-wheels', 'body-style'], as_index=False).mean(numeric_only=True)`

Compare how there were 203 rows in the previous picture and in total only 12 unique pairs in this grouped columns.  

- Step3: Pivotting the data:  
To "pivot" the data, i.e. to make it more structured and readable, we can use the Pandas `pivot()` function.  
`df_pivot=df_grp.pivot(index="drive-wheels", columns="body-style", values="price")`

- Step4: Heatmaps:  
Another way to represent the pivot table is using a heat map plot. It is a great way to plot the target variable over multiple variables, and through this, we get visual clues of the relationship between these variables and the target.  
 
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.pcolor(df_pivot, cmap="RdBu")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

In this example, we use Pyplot's pcolor method to plot heat map and convert the previous pivot table into a graphical form. We specified the red-blue color scheme.
